**Gallery Shooter - Harmony**
Gallery Shooter Implementation
Class assignment for CMPM 120
By: Lorraine Torres

Game includes player avatar movement, enemy waves, enemy paths, player emitted objects, multiple enemy types, score reward system, player health system, and level reset. (missing enemy emitted objects)

Bugs: collision with path following ghosts may cause lose of excess lives! (NOTE: you can see sound collision logic and game over logic by colliding with the bat on the lower part of the screen)

Code meets the following criteria:

Written in JavaScript using the Phaser game development library
Uses at least one Scene class
Uses keyboard input
Uses off-the-shelf art and audio assets (Uses Kenny Asset Packs)
Uses some mechanism to keep all game sprites/objects grouped together (Arrays and groups)
Use of loops to check for object collisions
an end game state that includes a visual component (Game over and win)
After the game ends, the game automatically resets to begin playing again (Done with an init_game() function)
